Super hilarious! Camille Cottin does so well in keeping this expression of “oh these plebes \<rolls eyes\>”. What I loved most is that all of the supporting actors are actually unsuspecting participants - sort of like a long form Candid Camera and you are told this only in the credits. Since she is French, there is also the obvious exagerrated contrast between British propriety and French nonchalance. \<Spoiler Alert\> You have to appreciate Cottin’s commitment to her craft. She spent a night in jail for climbing the Kensington Palace gate and interrupting the changing of the guard!
